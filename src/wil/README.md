# About WIL

The Windows Implementation Libraries (WIL) are a collection of header-only libraries used across Windows source code to make life easier for developers on Windows through readable type-safe C++ interfaces for common Windows coding patterns. For example, the WIL resource wrappers include "unique_ptr-like" wrappers for internal types, like HANDLEs and events.
